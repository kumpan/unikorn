## Unikorn’s digital strategy magic

Our professional team constructs a digital marketing strategy through the following three main pillars, to achieve efficiently the marked route, and the thought-through targets and goals:

* Channel strategies
* Web analysis and metrics
* Processes and ways of working

By conforming the strategy to be sustained under these three basic strongholds, we create a robust actioning procedure. A framework where everyone knows what to do, when to do it, and how to analyse the results, which provides cost-effectivity, time-efficiency, and high-performance grids.

### How does Unikorn’s channel strategy function?

The channel strategy developed by us presents a division and separation of the digital channels integrated into the online presence. An important appreciation fundamental to the message delivered because each channel has a purpose, tone, and focus-point. Identifying these present your company with the potential to formulate precise messages within each channel.

We cannot assume that all touch points are going to accept the exact same message, as they attract different audiences and target groups, in various decision phases. We believe that the one-size-fits-all mentality, fits no-one. 

Therefore, designing the correct voice-tone, text length, content type, and keyword structure for each communication channel, accentuates its performance. Resulting in better traction, brand awareness, interaction, and lead quality. Unikorn’s channel strategy accounts with, but not restricted to, an aiding apparatus which includes:

* Developing your company's vision into target images and KPIs.
* Creating:

  * A strategic framework for all channels and focus areas.
  * Strategies for each individual channel or focus area.
  * A priority action plan
* Result follow-ups assuring project learning outcomes.
