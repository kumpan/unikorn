Structured data is a method of providing detailed information about a webpage to search engines. It labels various parts of the page, such as articles, products, events, or businesses, enabling search engines to better understand the content. This information is embedded in the webpage's HTML code using specific rules known as schemas, which are defined by resources like [schema.org](http://schema.org).Â 

This guide will provide detailed instructions for implementing structured data using JSON-LD, the recommended format by Google.
