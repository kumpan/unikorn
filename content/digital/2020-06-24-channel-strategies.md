  preamble: To achieve results from your channels in the fastest possible and most
    efficient way, you must have a well-thought-out plan. This plan should not
    contain detailed information, but more describe what success looks like.
    It's called a vision.

The vision is translated into a strategic framework, that should act like a framework for all projects and investments you will need to make to achieve the goal. Within the strategic framework, a number of focus areas are identified, and a strategy is broken down per focus area or channel. 

It is only when you have arrived at the strategy of the individual channel that you see what you need to do to support your company's overall vision and goals, and that you can create an action plan to achieve the best results - for your company.
