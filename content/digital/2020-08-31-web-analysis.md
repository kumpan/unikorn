## Stats or your digital presence never happened!

Having an optimised website performance measure is key to learn from your business’ gains and failures. Without this implementation inside the strategy chain, we are dancing headless chickens, moving around the digital sphere without rhyme and reason. Inputting into the charts, indications of poor performance, and turning the tables form an investment to a black-hole sucking budgets without any positive ROI.

Limping in this area makes the path to better and strive for greater results, hugely complex. Even-more-so when it comes to knowing what metrics are key to understanding your customer’s journey and experience. Some measuring factors to keep in mind when tracking the data produced by customers, users or reviewers, on your website are:

* Sessions
* Leads, sign-ups, conversions, purchases and other goal completions
* Funnels and what channels your users used to end up completing a goal
* User experience metrics such as Core Web Vitals and the other experience metrics

Being able to acknowledge the potential of these metrics or measuring factors, is vital for, e.g. actioning a specific page, boosting time and budget on it, or on the contrary, cease the time and budget on a webpage.
