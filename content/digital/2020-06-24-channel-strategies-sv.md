## Digital Strategies in smaller pieces

The strategy formulation within your digital presence has to provide a general strategy, followed by other secondary strategies. One of these is the channel strategy involving a series of analysis to understand where your customers and target groups interact. Once these communities are revealed, there has to be a specific message for each channel, curated to standout and shine within each given platform.

The magic starts with a vision, that is translated into a strategic framework, which in its turn steers all projects and investments needed to achieve your set-goal. As mentioned earlier within the strategic framework, a number of focus areas are identified, and a strategy is broken down per focus area or channel. By implementing the secondary strategies forms a correlation to each channel offering a personalised format appealing to each audience.

To sparkle even brighter, apart from the strategies for each individual channel, your business needs to highlight the precise support to achieve the overall vision and goals. In other words, the time spent, voice-tone, content type, and text length, that will be pumped to each channel. Other important aspects are the amount of posting, publishing or uploading required to achieve the perfect balance between presence and disturbance.
