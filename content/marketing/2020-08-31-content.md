## Experts in Content Marketing

In fact, we have (almost) been working on content marketing since the birth of the internet (yes we are as old as the street). In addition, one of us is a trained journalist, the other has a black belt in SEO and in our network we have a whole army of talented creators who can do everything from creating great movies to engaging to death Instagram.

If you need help getting started with Content Marketing, you should contact us. We also do not lock you into long expensive contracts but help you get started, then we put you out of the nest so you can fly yourself. But first and foremost, maybe we should explain what Content Marketing is.

## What is Content Marketing?

Content Marketing or Content Marketing as it is called in Swedish is a way of working with content that attracts and interests your target group rather than disturbs them. If advertising is the interruption between the TV programs, it can be said that Content Marketing is the TV program itself. And why pay to be seen during breaks when you can be the main attraction?

Content Marketing is an incredibly important part of your digital marketing and content is what carries your message forward. But Content is also time consuming and quite difficult to do well. Therefore, it can be good to hire an agency to kickstart your content marketing if you want to get started quickly.

### Content Marketing includes:

* Current situation analysis
* Target group analysis
* Customer journey
* Content plan
* Production of text, image and video
* SEO 
* Dissemination in Social Media

## Not just text

When you talk about content, you often talk about the written text on a page, but content is also the text on all links, it is videos, images and design, subtitles, posts in social media, you name it!

In addition to producing content for web and social media, we also create entire communication concepts that interest and give your target group something. It can be compared to the work of producing a TV program or a newspaper. To help us, we have a whole bunch of professional and incredibly talented creators, screenwriters, filmmakers, writers and journalists that we can hire when we need. In this way we get a very scalable and dynamic team of real professionals.

## How does Unikorn Content Marketing do?

UNIKORN loves to look at the whole. We never start producing until we know why we do it. That is why we always start by looking at the current situation, purpose and goals. What do you want to achieve with your marketing and why? Then map the target group and the customer journey, make a strategy and a content plan.

Together with you and / or our creators, we then produce the content. It can be texts, a video series, a podcast or something completely different that suits your business and target group, we usually combine several different formats to get the most out of the content. Of course, we adapt the content to different channels such as web, social media and marketing automation.

When the content is produced, we put together a plan for how it will be disseminated, in which channels and to which target groups. We develop dashboards and follow up, analyze and optimize along the way so that you know that you really get results from your investment.
