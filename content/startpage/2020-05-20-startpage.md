        SEO stands for Search Engine Optimisation, and is a collection of
        disciplines to make your content rank for relevant search queries on
        search engines. SEO is important for many websites, to make sure the
        users are able to find and interact with the desired content, when they
        search for it. 


        Disciplines in SEO are for example:


        * Technical optimisation

        * Content Creation

        * Links and authority building

        * User engagement optimisation

        * App Store Optimisation (ASO)

        * YouTube Optimisation

        * ...and more
    - question: This is another question?

        It’s about making placeholder text great again. That’s what people want,
        they want placeholder text to be great again. I think the only card she
        has is the Lorem card.


        We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice." I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful.
