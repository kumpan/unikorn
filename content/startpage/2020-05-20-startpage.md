    - question: What is SEO
      answer: >-
        SEO stands for Search Engine Optimisation, and is a collection of
        disciplines to make your content rank for relevant search queries on
        search engines. SEO is important for many websites, to make sure the
        users are able to find and interact with the desired content, when they
        search for it. 


        Disciplines in SEO are for example:


        * Technical optimisation

        * Content Creation

        * Links and authority building

        * User engagement optimisation

        * App Store Optimisation (ASO)

        * YouTube Optimisation

        * ...and more
    - question: What is Unikorn Marketing
      answer: >-
        Unikorn Marketing is an aggressive marketing and user focused way of
        working we have developed at Unikorn. 


        With aggressive we mean to help companies kick off their marketing efforts, or go-to-market phase, aggressively in order to gain as much traction as possible.  


        Regardless of what channel or marketing technique is on the table, the user always has to be the deciding factor of what direction to take or action to be prioritised.


        We use the Unikorn Marketing focus on:


        * SoMe

        * SEO

        * SEM

        * Display

        * ...and more
    - question: What is a Search Customer Journey?
      answer: >-
        A search customer journey is a model we use at Unikorn, developed by
        Ulrika Viberg. 


        The model is based on a traditional customer journey, with the phases awareness, interest, consideration, evaluation and conversion. As these phases translates to the search intents of informational, transactional and commercial searches, they can be added as a layer on the customer journey.


        As we often do customer journeys as a start-off in our web projects, it seemed logical to add a layer of search on top of it.
