    - question: What is SEO
      answer: >-
        SEO stands for Search Engine Optimisation, and is a collection of
        disciplines to make your content rank for relevant search queries on
        search engines. SEO is important for many websites, to make sure the
        users are able to find and interact with the desired content when they
        search for it.


        We must remember that the Internet is a vast space offering huge opportunities, and also immense downfall because no matter how good is the product and/or service if it’s not visible there’s nothing to do. SEO plays a vital part in this visibility because one of its prime objectives is the content presentation focused on users and search bots (crawlers, spiders).


        Some SEO disciplines we use, to achieve a perfect balance between the necessities of the users and those of the search engine crawlers include:


        * Technical optimisation

        * Content Creation

        * Links and authority building

        * User engagement optimisation

        * App Store Optimisation (ASO)

        * YouTube Optimisation

        * ...and more


        To be able to foster and nurture these techniques, patience is crucial, and craftsmanship vital, these reasons make it clear SEO is a fundamental pillar in the digital marketing space. Thus, a solid team of specialised professionals is required to reach the set-targets and we at Unikorn have the knowledge, know-how, and the wo-manpower to reach your businesses online needs through our curated SEO.


        Interesting facts that may shine a better light on SEO are the top-5 search engines worldwide, at number #1 Google, #2 Bing, #3 Baidu, #4 Yahoo, and #5 Yandex. Google alone holds the crown encompassing market share at over 90%, and Bing, in second places has a 2%-12% market share. Inside this top-5 the amount of users who surf the search engines rises to over 4,000,000,000 which is nearly 60% of the World’s population.


        We hope these fun-facts have shed a light on the empowering force SEO is for your Digital Marketing, and through many of its streams. One that shines brightest is the humongous amount of users searching the web on informational, commercial, and transactional search basis. Other aspects shining are the exponential market share the #1 search engine has. Data that forms the picture of the paths a business needs to walk, for its digital presence to standout from the crowd.

    - question: What is a Search Customer Journey?
      answer: >-
        A search customer journey is a model we use at Unikorn, developed by
        Ulrika Viberg.


        The model is based on a traditional customer journey, with the phases awareness, interest, consideration, evaluation and conversion. As these phases translate to the search intents of informational, transactional and commercial searches, they can be added as a layer on the customer journey.


        In this sense, as we often do customer journeys as a start-off in our web projects, it seemed logical to add a layer of search on top of it. Resulting in:


        * Inspirational content for the awareness phase.

        * Situational and informational content inside the interest stage + Informational search.

        * Consideration phase offers USP (Unique selling proposition) and value proposition content + Informational and commercial search.

        * Evaluation phase translating into reviews and cases production + Informational and transactional search.

        * Purchase stage produces CRO (Conversion rate optimisation) and secure purchasing content + Transactional search.


        Servicing a search customer journey as ours, the exactitude, relates to minimal changes in e.g. keywords’ slight differences “wine with food” and “wine and food”, as Ulrika explains in the following in-depth article about Unikorn’s customer journey.
