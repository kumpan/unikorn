    - question: What is SEO?
      answer: >-
        SEO - Search Engine Optimisation - is several strategies and
        optimisations that help your website rank higher in search engines like
        Google. This in turn can have a dramatic effect on organic traffic. In
        short, it is a cost-effective complement to more traditional forms of
        marketing.


        W﻿ith an increasing percentage of user journeys beginning with a query in a search engine, it is becoming integral for websites and companies to be visible on the results pages.

    - question: Can SEO help us reach our business goals?
      answer: >-
        **Yes.** 


        SEO is the organic road to marketing, meaning it helps your customer find you. In this way, you don't have to rely on on large billboards or clever ads in social media feeds. I﻿t's not unusual for good SEO to drive around 60% of a website's traffic. In other words, it is one of the biggest digital marketing channels today.

    - question: How does SEO work together with other types of digital marketing?
      answer: >-
        We should always look at marketing holistically, and how our channels
        can complement each other. Your digital channels can serve the double
        purpose of activating your website’s content and increasing your link
        building, two crucial things for ranking high in Google.


        Moreover, user behaviour and user journeys are becoming increasingly complex. They move between channels in unpredictable ways, both digital and analogue. Therefore it is important to have digital strategies that cater to these movements and that create seamless experiences.


        With good SEO you will be ready for search queries at every step of the user journey, no matter which channel your users came from, leading to higher conversion rates and more loyal users.

    - question: How quickly can you see results from SEO work?
      answer: >-
        SEO is like planting a seed. If you care for it properly in the
        beginning it will start growing pretty quickly. And if you keep caring
        for it, there is no limit to how much it can grow.


        But leaving the analogies aside, first results are usually noticeable around two weeks after you begin implementing an SEO strategy.
    - question: Can’t we just buy links?
      answer: >-
        Google’s algorithms are more adept at identifying and punishing bought
        links and link spamming these days. Backlinks should be relevant to your
        content and not bought from the source. If Google does not see why the
        link from another webpage makes sense for your content, you will not get
        any advantage in the Google Search.
