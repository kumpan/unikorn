## Magic doesn't just happen, sometimes you need a Unikorn

Unikorn is a boutique agency focusing on Digital Marketing Strategies, Growth Hacking and Advanced SEO.

Friends are important, especially when you are small and that is why Unikorn has built a vast network of other experienced boutique agencies, consultants and freelancers, so that we can deliver top results in any digital project.

The company was founded by Ulrika Viberg in 2016 when she was a full-time consultant for eBay Classified Group, based out of London. After returning to Sweden early 2018, Ulrika decided to continue to do consultancy work under Unikorn. Today we help a number of large to small organisations with their digital journey.
