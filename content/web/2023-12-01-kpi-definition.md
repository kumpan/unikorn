## Common Challenges

Identifying valuable KPIs is a process, and we are here to help you navigate through it. A major challenge is the extensive array of available data presented in various tools. We are specialists in discerning metrics worth focusing on that create insights making a difference for your business objectives.

## Our KPI Process

1. **Business Objectives:** We start by understanding your specific business goals, whether it's increasing sales, engagement, or customer loyalty.
2. **Website Analysis:** Our team evaluates your current website to identify strengths and areas for improvement, shaping relevant KPIs for conversion and SEO.
3. **Selection of Metrics:** We carefully choose metrics that directly reflect your business objectives and web potential.
4. **Simplicity:** Less is more. We believe in limiting tracking to data that offers clear insights and actual value, therefore we meticulously filter out metrics of low or dubious value.
5. **Ongoing Evaluation:** We continuously refine the focus on what is valuable, to keep KPIs updated following internal strategies and market trends.
