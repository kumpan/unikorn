## Your New Favourite Moving Company

Website migration refers to those considerable changes to a website that can have a significant impact on its visibility in search engines. These can be changes to a website’s location or platform, an overhaul of its content, or a shakeup of its structure, design, or UX. All these areas are generally points of interest for an SEO strategy.

This is why it’s important to have SEO experts in the meeting room when planning any migration project, ideally SEO experts with lots of experience in website migration. We will be there from the planning stages to implementation and beyond, being as hands-on as you need us to be. There are many pitfalls involved in a migration, but our Unikorns can spot them from miles away.

Some of the things we will help you with are:

* Project Management
* Technical Audit of the new website
* Comparative Audits between old and new website
* URL migration mapping
* Set up and testing of new tracking services



Change is always scary, but with us by your side it’s always a good thing. We’ll make sure to check every nook and cranny for hidden monsters, and guide the whole process, so you come out of it ranking higher than ever before.
